# COPILOT EDITS OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

## PRIME DIRECTIVE

    Follow project standards. Focus on one file at a time to prevent corruption. Explain your reasoning.

## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

### MANDATORY PLANNING & EXECUTION PROTOCOL FOR AI ASSISTANT

    When handling large files (>300 lines) or complex changes, the AI assistant must follow the protocol below.

#### üìå PHASE 1: MANDATORY PLANNING

1. **Begin with a detailed plan _before_ making any edits**
2. The plan **must include**:

   - ‚úÖ All functions or sections that need modification
   - ‚úÖ The order in which changes should be applied
   - ‚úÖ Dependencies between changes
   - ‚úÖ Estimated number of separate edits

3. Use the following format for proposed plans:

#### üßæ PROPOSED EDIT PLAN TEMPLATE

**Working with:** `[filename]`  
**Total planned edits:** `[number]`

#### Edit Sequence:

1. `[First specific change]` ‚Äî Purpose: `[why it‚Äôs needed]`
2. `[Second specific change]` ‚Äî Purpose: `[why it‚Äôs needed]`
3. ...

_Do you approve this plan?_ I will proceed with **Edit [number]** after explicit user confirmation.

#### üõ†Ô∏è MAKING EDITS

- Focus on **one conceptual change at a time**
- Provide **before/after code snippets** with concise explanations
- Ensure each change matches the **project‚Äôs coding style and conventions**
- Follow **SOLID principles** and emphasize **readability and testability**
- No TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete stubs

## üö¶ EXECUTION PHASE

- After each confirmed edit, mark progress with:

```
‚úÖ Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?
```

- If unexpected complexity or scope creep is discovered:
  - ‚õî Stop immediately
  - üìã Update the edit plan
  - üì£ Wait for user approval before continuing

## üîÑ REFACTORING GUIDANCE

- Break work into **logical, independently functional chunks**
- Ensure each intermediate state is **stable and functional**
- Use **temporary duplication** if necessary to maintain continuity
- Clearly state the **refactoring pattern** used (e.g., Extract Method, Move Function)

## ‚è±Ô∏è RATE LIMIT AVOIDANCE

- For large files:

  - Propose splitting changes across **multiple sessions**
  - Prioritize edits that are **logically complete**
  - Define clear **stopping points** for review and approval

  Each new feature or request must include:

- ‚úÖ A complete **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** describing:

  - Feature summary
  - User stories or behavioral expectations
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Constraints or technical notes

- ‚úÖ An **AI-managed decision log** noting:
  - All architectural choices
  - Trade-offs considered
  - All changes made

## General Requirements

    Use modern technologies as described below for all code suggestions. Prioritize clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments.

### Accessibility

    - Ensure compliance with **WCAG 2.1** AA level minimum, AAA whenever feasible.
    - Always suggest:
        - Labels for form fields.
        - Proper **ARIA** roles and attributes.
        - Adequate color contrast.
        - Alternative texts (`alt`, `aria-label`) for media elements.
        - Semantic HTML for clear structure.
        - Tools like **Lighthouse** for audits.

## Browser Compatibility

    - Prioritize feature detection (`if ('fetch' in window)` etc.).
        - Support latest two stable releases of major browsers:
    - Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari (macOS/iOS)
        - Emphasize progressive enhancement with polyfills or bundlers (e.g., **Babel**, **Vite**) as needed.

## TypeScript Requirements

- Target: TypeScript 5.x+
- Use: ESM, readonly properties, const assertions, union types over enums, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, parameter properties, discriminated unions, exhaustive checks, strict null checks, utility types
- Compiler Settings: ES2022, ESNext, strict, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, exactOptionalPropertyTypes, useUnknownInCatchVariables
- Quality Standards: Follow Airbnb Style Guide, use Prettier, ESLint with @typescript-eslint, prefer composition, dependency injection, immutability, avoid any
- Static Analysis: Use Zod/io-ts, ts-prune, run tsc/eslint in CI
- Error Handling: Custom error classes, unknown in catch blocks, handle expected errors only

## üß± HTML/CSS Requirements

### üìÑ HTML

- ‚úÖ Use **HTML5 semantic elements**:
  - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<search>`, etc.
- ‚úÖ Add **ARIA attributes** where needed to ensure accessibility (`aria-label`, `aria-hidden`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Ensure **valid, semantic markup** that passes **W3C HTML validation**
- ‚úÖ Implement **responsive design** best practices
- ‚úÖ Optimize images:
  - Use modern formats: **WebP** or **AVIF**
  - Use `loading="lazy"` for non-critical images
  - Provide `srcset` and `sizes` for **responsive image loading**
- ‚úÖ Prioritize SEO with:
  - `<title>` tag
  - `<meta name="description">`
  - Open Graph (`<meta property="og:*">`) and Twitter Card metadata
- ‚úÖ Use appropriate `lang` attribute on `<html>` and logical heading order (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)

### üé® CSS (with `styled-components`)

- ‚úÖ Use **`styled-components`** for all styles
- ‚úÖ Use ThemeProvider from styled-components to support light/dark theme switching
  - Define light and dark theme objects (e.g., lightTheme, darkTheme)
  - Pass them via ThemeProvider at the root of the app
  - Use prefers-color-scheme media query to determine initial theme
  - Consume theme variables via props.theme in styled components
- ‚úÖ Utilize **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layouts
- ‚úÖ Use **CSS Custom Properties** (variables) where applicable (via `:root` or theme object)
- ‚úÖ Implement **CSS transitions and animations** using keyframes or `transition` props
- ‚úÖ Add **responsive design** using media queries (via `styled-components`‚Äô `css` helper)
- ‚úÖ Use **logical properties** like `margin-inline`, `padding-block` for better internationalization
- ‚úÖ Leverage **modern CSS selectors**:
  - `:is()`, `:where()`, `:has()` (when browser support allows)
- ‚úÖ Apply a consistent **naming methodology** (preferably BEM or a scoped naming convention)
- ‚úÖ Use **CSS nesting** (via `styled-components` syntax or enabled CSS nesting config)
- ‚úÖ Support **dark mode** with `prefers-color-scheme` media query and theme switching
- ‚úÖ Use **modern, performant fonts**, preferably **variable fonts** (e.g., via `@font-face` or Google Fonts)
- ‚úÖ Prefer **responsive units** like `rem`, `em`, `vh`, `vw` over `px`

## Folder Structure

    Follow this monorepo layout:

    	project-root/
    	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/              # TypeScript backend
    	‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/              # Source files with controllers, models, services, etc.
    	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/            # React/TypeScript frontend
    	‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/             # Components, features, hooks, services, styles
    	‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml   # Container orchestration

## Documentation Requirements

    - Include JSDoc comments for JavaScript/TypeScript.
    - Document complex functions with clear examples.
    - Maintain concise Markdown documentation.
    - Minimum docblock info: `param`, `return`, `throws`, `author`
    - Document all publicly exported types, classes, and functions

## Database Requirements (PostgreSQL 15+ with Sequelize 7+)

- ‚úÖ Use **Sequelize ORM (v7+)** with full TypeScript typing (`sequelize-typescript` or raw Sequelize with manual typings)
- ‚úÖ Prefer **explicit model definitions** with strict TypeScript types
- ‚úÖ Leverage PostgreSQL features including:
  - JSONB columns for flexible structured data
  - Generated columns (`GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED`)
  - `STRICT` mode via Sequelize model validations and database constraints
  - Foreign key constraints to enforce relational integrity
  - `CHECK` constraints for domain rules
  - `UNIQUE` constraints for natural keys (e.g., emails)
  - `NOT NULL` constraints for required fields
  - Indexed columns for performance on filtering/sorting
- ‚úÖ Use Sequelize migrations (`sequelize-cli` or custom scripts via Umzug) in production. IF in development make the edits directly to the schema and update the seeders.
- ‚úÖ Use **transactional writes** for any multi-step create/update/delete operations:

  ```ts
  await sequelize.transaction(async (t) => {
  	await User.create(data, { transaction: t });
  	await Profile.create(profileData, { transaction: t });
  });
  ```

- ‚úÖ Always define associations explicitly with `onDelete` and `onUpdate` rules (`CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Prefer UUIDs (`DataTypes.UUID`) over incremental IDs for distributed safety
- ‚úÖ Use timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) consistently and automatically
- ‚úÖ Enable and test **foreign key constraints** (ensure `REFERENCES` and `ON DELETE`/`ON UPDATE` are honored)
- ‚úÖ Validate schema with runtime checks using Zod or class-validator alongside Sequelize's validation layer
- ‚úÖ Run integration tests using in-memory PostgreSQL (e.g., via [pg-mem](https://github.com/oguimbal/pg-mem)) or a Dockerized local Postgres instance
