## Technical Constraints & Notes

- The application must use the TMDb API for content metadata
- The system must comply with TMDb API rate limits (40 requests/10 seconds)
- Authentication must use short-lived JWTs with refresh token rotation
- The database schema must support UUIDs for primary keys
- The application must support modern browsers only
- The system must use Docker for containerized deployment
- Component library must be shared between client and admin applications
