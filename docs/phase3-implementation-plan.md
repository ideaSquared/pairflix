_Created: June 3, 2025_

## 📋 Overview

Phase 3 of the PairFlix project focuses on technical improvements, standardization, and optimizations rather than new features. This phase will enhance the maintainability, performance, and developer experience of the application while preparing it for production deployment.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

1. **Component Library Refinement**
2. **Docker Build Optimization**
3. **Admin Authentication Flow Improvements**
4. **Cross-Application Layout Standardization**
5. **UI Component Deduplication**
6. **Performance Optimizations for Data-Heavy Views**

## 📊 Implementation Strategy

### 1. Component Library Refinement and Standardization

The component library (`lib.components`) needs refinement to ensure consistency across both applications (client and admin). This includes standardizing component APIs, improving TypeScript type definitions, and ensuring all components follow the project's design system.

#### Technical Approach

1. **Component Audit**: Inventory all existing components across both applications and the component library
2. **API Standardization**: Define consistent props interfaces for all components
3. **Theme Integration**: Ensure all components use the theming system correctly
4. **Documentation**: Add Storybook documentation for all components
5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit tests

#### Tasks

- [ ] Create component inventory spreadsheet with component name, location, and reuse status
- [ ] Analyze component APIs for inconsistencies and create standardization plan
- [ ] Refine theme system to ensure cross-application consistency
- [ ] Define standard prop patterns (e.g., size variants, color variants)
- [ ] Implement Storybook for component documentation
- [ ] Add Jest/RTL tests for all shared components
- [ ] Create migration guide for application-specific components

#### Dependencies

- Existing components in `lib.components`
- Theme definitions in both applications

   - Integrated with theme system and authentication

2. **Navigation System Standardized**
