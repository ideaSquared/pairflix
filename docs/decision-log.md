Created separate endpoints for user-only activities, partner activities, and combined social feeds. | 1. Created `getPartnerActivities` function using Match model to identify accepted partners<br>2. Implemented `getUserSocialActivities` to filter out system activities (login, search, profile updates)<br>3. Added three distinct endpoints: `/api/activity/me` (user only), `/api/activity/partner` (partners only), `/api/activity/feed` (user + partners)<br>4. Social activities include: WATCHLIST_ADD/UPDATE/REMOVE/RATE, MATCH_ACCEPTED/CREATE<br>5. System activities excluded: USER_LOGIN/LOGOUT/PASSWORD_CHANGE/PROFILE_UPDATE, MEDIA_SEARCH/VIEW<br>6.
