# üìù AI-managed Decision Log

## Architectural Decisions

1. **Decision:** Adopt a monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend

   - **Context:** Need to organize code for a full-stack application with shared types
   - **Alternatives Considered:**
     - Polyrepo (separate repositories) - More independence but harder to keep in sync
     - Single codebase without separation - Simpler but less maintainable
   - **Rationale:** Monorepo provides the best balance of separation of concerns while maintaining project cohesion

2. **Decision:** Use React with TypeScript for frontend

   - **Context:** Need a robust UI framework with type safety
   - **Alternatives Considered:**
     - Vue.js - Good alternative but smaller ecosystem
     - Angular - More opinionated but steeper learning curve
   - **Rationale:** React offers the best combination of flexibility, ecosystem support, and performance for this application

3. **Decision:** Implement Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript

   - **Context:** Need a lightweight, flexible backend that shares language with frontend
   - **Alternatives Considered:**
     - NestJS - More structured but additional complexity
     - FastAPI (Python) - Different language ecosystem
   - **Rationale:** Express with TypeScript offers the right balance of structure and flexibility

4. **Decision:** Use PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM

   - **Context:** Need a robust relational database with JSON support
   - **Alternatives Considered:**
     - MongoDB - Document store, less structured
     - Prisma ORM - Newer but less mature than Sequelize
   - **Rationale:** PostgreSQL provides the best combination of relational integrity and flexible data types

5. **Decision:** Implement JWT authentication
   - **Context:** Need secure, stateless authentication for a small-scale app
   - **Alternatives Considered:**
     - Session-based auth - Requires more server resources
     - OAuth - Overkill for a private two-user application
   - **Rationale:** JWT offers the right balance of security and simplicity for this use case

## Trade-offs

- **API Integration:** Prioritized TMDb API over alternatives due to rich metadata and simpler integration, accepting the rate limit constraints
- **User Management:** Chose manual user setup over registration flow, trading flexibility for simplicity in a two-user application
- **Data Architecture:** Selected a normalized database schema over NoSQL approach, prioritizing data integrity over schema flexibility
- **Feature Scope:** Focused on core matching functionality first, deferring advanced features like activity feed to later phases

## Changes Implemented

The implementation follows the structure outlined in the project files:

### Backend

- Created controllers for auth, match, search, user, and watchlist functionality
- Implemented service layer with business logic separation
- Set up database models and connections
- Added middleware for authentication and error handling
- Developed comprehensive test suite

### Frontend

- Built component library with common UI elements
- Implemented feature-based architecture (auth, watchlist, match)
- Created responsive layouts and typography system
- Developed API service layer for backend communication
- Implemented authentication flow with token management

## Uncertainty Notes

- **TMDb API Reliability:** Confidence level: Medium

  - External API dependency may change or have downtime
  - Mitigation: Implement caching and fallback mechanisms

- **Performance with Large Watchlists:** Confidence level: Medium

  - Match algorithm efficiency may decrease with very large watchlists
  - Mitigation: Implement pagination and optimize database queries

- **User Experience Design:** Confidence level: High

  - Simple two-user model reduces complexity
  - Validation through user testing will confirm assumptions

- **Security Model:** Confidence level: High
  - JWT implementation follows best practices
  - Limited user base reduces attack surface
